# Speed-Math

The server generates a random expression with two operands, stores the response, and then sends the expression to all clients. The first client to send a correct response wins, then the next expression is generated, and so on.

First, run the code from the "server" folder, then connect to the server running program from folder "client" or, for example, using telnet.
You can play from devices in you local network :)
